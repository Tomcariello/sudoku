Sudoku challenge work flow:
	[*] Visually represent the Sudoku game board (HTML/CSS)
	[*] Allow system for entry of puzzle numbers (HTML/CSS/JQuery)
	[*] Represent these numbers clearly on the game board (HTML/CSS/JQuery)
	[*] Display all possible numbers (1-9) for each blank square (HTML/CSS/JQuery)
	[*] Level 1 Analysis: Proces all finalized numbers for each  blank squares & show user user(JQuery)
	[*] Level 2 Analysis: Process 2 digit arrays & process numbers of duplicated arrays (Row, Col, & Box)
	[*] Create collection of sudoku games to allow users a variety of initial boards (Just 5 for now)
		[*] Randomize game selection on "New Game"; reset current game on "Reset Game"
	[*] Prevent user from entering number greater than 9
	[*] Set hover highlight on gameboard to show all of the gridpoints that are associated with the field being hovered
	[*] Create "Hint" and "Solve" buttons. 
		[*] Hint should give the user 1 new correct number
		[*] Solve should work recursively until the puzzle is solved or no more moves are known
	[x] Create Sudoku game generator
	[ ] Validate numbers entered by user against solved puzzle (i.e. user can't enter incorrect numbers)
	[ ] Game board improvements:
		[ ] Make game board bigger
		[ ] Hovering over a entered number highlights all instances of that number on the grid
		[ ] Number Entry can be down with HTML buttons (no keyboard required). Will improve iPad experience.
		[ ] Hint Board:
			[ ] Integrate into the main game board as notes?
	[ ] Add "confirm" button. This will validate no duplicates & that all rows/columns/boxes add to 45
	[ ] Refactor codebase to make this a node app to current standards:
		[ ] Remove JQuery
		[ ] Remove all 'eval' statements
	[ ] Refactor current analysis code:
		[ ] Seperate analysis code to seperate file(s)
		[ ] Adjust brevity & clarity
		[ ] Explain the process
	[ ] Level 3 Analysis: Process 2 & 3 digit arrays & process numbers of duplicated arrays (Row, Col, & Box)
