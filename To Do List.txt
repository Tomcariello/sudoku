Sudoku challenge work flow:
	[*] Visually represent the Sudoku game board (HTML/CSS)
	[*] Allow system for entry of puzzle numbers (HTML/CSS/JQuery)
	[*] Represent these numbers clearly on the game board (HTML/CSS/JQuery)
	[*] Display all possible numbers (1-9) for each blank square (HTML/CSS/JQuery)
	[*] Level 1 Analysis: Proces all finalized numbers for each  blank squares & show user user(JQuery)
	[*] Level 2 Analysis: Process 2 digit arrays & process numbers of duplicated arrays (Row, Col, & Box)
	[*] Create collection of sudoku games to allow users a variety of initial boards (Just 5 for now)
		[*] Randomize game selection on "New Game"; reset current game on "Reset Game"
	[*] Prevent user from entering number greater than 9
	[*] Set hover highlight on gameboard to show all of the gridpoints that are associated with the field being hovered
	[*] Create "Hint" and "Solve" buttons. 
		[*] Hint should give the user 1 new correct number
		[*] Solve should work recursively until the puzzle is solved or no more moves are known
	[*] Create Sudoku game generator
	[*] Validate numbers entered by user against solved puzzle
	[*] Game board improvements:
		[*] Make game board bigger
		[*] Hovering over an entered number highlights all instances of that number on the grid
			[*] Change hover to active node highlighting
			[*] Fix hover of Snyder Notes
		[*] Allow Snyder notes
		[*] Number Entry can be done with HTML buttons (no keyboard required)
	[*] Color Code provided values
	[*] Lock inputs for provided values on game start
	[ ] Do a Highlight process on number guess (currently have to reselect for highlights)
	[ ] Indicate if a number is completely solved
	[ ] Work on sudoku generation to prevent unsolvable boards
	[ ] Add "Clear" button to clear a node
	[ ] Add "confirm" button to validate board
		[ ] No duplicates
		[ ] All rows/columns/boxes add to 45
	
	As we go about the refactor, keep in mind modernizing the codebase:
		[ ] Remove JQuery
		[ ] Remove all 'eval' statements
		[ ] Replace hard-coded HTML
	
	Hints & solve are broken currently. Get UI stable & then bring this back.
	[ ] Refactor current analysis code:
		[*] Separate analysis code to seperate file(s)
		[ ] Adjust for brevity & clarity
		[ ] Explain the process
		[ ] Split to smaller, focused functions
	[ ] Level 3 Analysis: Process 2 & 3 digit arrays & process numbers of duplicated arrays (Row, Col, & Box)
