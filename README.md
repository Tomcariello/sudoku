# sudoku

To Do:
Clear arrays for static set number and highlight those boxes to indicate static answers.
Highlight arrays with only 1 single number left (this should ultimately be automated)
Add "confirm" button. This will validate no duplicates & that all rows/columns/boxes add to 45
Create algorithm for more in-depth analysis of the board
