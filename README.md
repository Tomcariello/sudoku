# Sudoku project
This project was conceived 10 years ago as a method for me to improve my coding & Sudoku playing. I spent minimal effort on UI & dove into the coding required to "solve" every puzzle. Unfortunately, I'm not a very good Sudoku player so the Solve feature never truly worked for puzzles much more than medium.

I'm a better coder now & a better Sudoku player. I am revisiting this in 2025 & hope to polish up the frontend, modernize & improve the JS & improve the solving methods. My goal is to provide a free  Sudoku app that works well on an iPad (all devices, really, but iPad is top of my list), & host for free in github pages (no Node.js for now).

If you stumble across this project, feel free to drop me a message with any bugs you find, features you'd like, or whatever else is on your mind.
