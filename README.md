# sudoku

To Do:
Clear arrays for static set number and highlight those boxes to indicate static answers.
Highlight arrays with only 1 single number left (this should ultimately be automated when "solved")
Add "confirm" button. This will validate no duplicates & that all rows/columns/boxes add to 45
Create algorithm(s) to better solve puzzles
