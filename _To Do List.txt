Sudoku challenge work flow:
	[*] Visually represent the Sudoku game board (HTML/CSS)
	[*] Allow system for entry of puzzle numbers (HTML/CSS/JQuery)
	[*] Represent these numbers clearly on the game board (HTML/CSS/JQuery)
	[*] Display all possible numbers (1-9) for each blank square (HTML/CSS/JQuery)
	[*] Level 1 Analysis: Proces all finalized numbers for each  blank squares & show user user(JQuery)
	[*] Level 2 Analysis: Process 2 digit arrays & process numbers of duplicated arrays (Row, Col, & Box)
	[*] Create collection of sudoku games to allow users a variety of initial boards (Just 5 for now)
	[*] Create "Hint" and "Solve" buttons. 
		[ ] Hint should give the user 1 new correct number at random

	[ ] Allow easier entry of numbers on the grid
	[*] Set hover highlight on gameboard to show all of the gridpoints that are associated with the field being hovered
	[ ] Level 3 Analysis: Process 2 & 3 digit arrays & process numbers of duplicated arrays (Row, Col, & Box)
	[ ] Refactor all analysis code for brevity & clarity
